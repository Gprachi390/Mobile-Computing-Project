# Bon-Voyage - Tour Management System
The  project Tour Management system helps us in selecting a place based on different aspects which are given as inputs from the user and also this system provides an easy way to manage all the bookings, check the reviews and experiences  of the people who traveled to that particular place, provides the details of the guides available in order book a guide to view that place. At last it acts like a complete trip planning and tour management system.
